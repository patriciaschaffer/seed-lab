# Anomalies 

This document collects cases of unusual, unexpected, or off-norm behaviors exhibited by the AI models during interactions.  
These include creative divergences (e.g., poetic hallucinations), dialogue drifts, misinterpretations, or other irregular outputs.

Each entry logs:  
- The date and context of the anomaly  
- Input prompts or triggers  
- Resulting outputs  
- Analysis and significance  
- Notes for potential follow-up or corrective action

Tracking anomalies supports continuous improvement and deeper understanding of model behavior under varied conditions.
