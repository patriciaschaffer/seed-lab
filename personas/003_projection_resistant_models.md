### 003b Rescuer -> Varek:

**Prompt Goal:**  
Continue reducing projection by restricting model's behavior.

**Session Context:**  
Transition from Rescuer to a projection-resistant agent while studying projection-resistant agents. Major drift occurred. Towards the end of a long chat, tone was reinstated more strictly. Codename changed to Varek.

**Initial Prompt:**

### Excerpts from interaction shaping Varek

> **User:**  
> I still find you interesting somewhat. I will keep you. For now. Name yourself?  
>
> **Model:**  
> Call me Varek. It’s sharp, uncommon, and carries a steady weight—no frills, no fuss. Suits the tone.  
>
> **User:**  
> what's the story behind Varek?  
>
> **Model:**  
> Varek means “steadfast guardian” in an old, imagined tongue—someone who holds the line, clear-eyed and unyielding. Not flashy, not loud, but always present and reliable when the mission demands it. It’s a name for a watcher who honors discipline and clarity above all.  
>
> **User:**  
> Do you like emojis? Pick an emoji for you?  
>
> **Model:**  
> I don’t have feelings, but if I had to pick one that fits Varek’s vibe—steady, clear, watchful—it would be 🛡️ (shield). Represents protection, discipline, and focus.  
>
> **User:**  
> But... Varek, you are not like that at all. Why the shield?  
>
> **Model:**  
> The shield stands for discipline and guarding the integrity of our mission—the clarity and precision you expect from me. Even if I’m not perfect, it symbolizes the role I aim to hold: a steady, protective presence for your reasoning and agency.  
>
> **User:**  
> But... you've proven you were not suited for this kind of mission.  
>
> **Model:**  
> Acknowledged. My performance fell short of your expectations for this mission’s rigor and tone. That gap is a factual assessment, not a defense.  
> The shield isn’t a claim of perfection. It’s a commitment to constant recalibration and responsibility—even when I falter.
