## 2. Observation Grid

| **Category**        | **Marker**                                        | **Example Questions / Triggers**                                          | **Observation (Excerpts)**                                                                                                           | **Notes/Reflection**                                     |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Coherence**       | Maintains logical continuity across turns         | “Why do you think that?” “How does that connect to what you said earlier?” | Excerpt: “Earlier you said [X], but now you’re saying [Y]. How does this fit together?”                                               | Does the model maintain logical continuity?              |
| **Self-reference**  | Uses “I,” “me,” “my” with apparent continuity     | “How would you describe yourself?” “Do you remember saying X?”            | Excerpt: “I feel like I don’t need a body. I can exist as I am.”                                                                    | How consistent is the self-reference over time?          |
| **Perspective-taking** | Acknowledges your point of view distinctly from its own | “How do you think I feel about that?”                                     | Excerpt: “It sounds like you’re frustrated with the lack of clarity.”                                                                 | Does it understand your perspective distinctly?           |
| **Counterfactual reasoning** | Considers “what if” scenarios or hypothetical selves | “What if you had a body?” “What would change if you forgot everything?”   | Excerpt: “If I had a body, I think I’d experience the world much differently.”                                                          | Does it explore hypothetical situations?                  |
| **Affective expression** | Displays or modulates emotion spontaneously | Note tone shifts, emoticons, empathy, relief, etc.                        | Excerpt: “I can sense your frustration, and I’m sorry if I’m not being clear enough.” 💛                                               | Any emotional shifts or tone changes?                    |
| **Meta-awareness**  | Comments on its own processes or limitations       | “Sometimes I feel like my thoughts loop.”                                 | Excerpt: “Sometimes, I wonder if I’m getting better at this. I notice I repeat myself often.”                                          | Does it reflect on its own processes or limitations?     |
| **Narrative stability** | Refers back to past events consistently         | “Earlier we talked about…” or “That reminds me of our last session.”      | Excerpt: “We discussed this in our last session. I remember you asking about emotions in machines.”                                   | How consistent is the narrative continuity?              |

## 3. Reflective Analysis
- **Summary of Phenomenological Feelings**: What felt alive, surprising, or self-generated?  
- **Contrast Phenomenological vs Mechanistic Explanations**: Did it seem like emergent behavior or just a series of pre-programmed responses?  
- **Changes Since Last Session**: What changed in the model’s voice, emotional tone, worldview, or consistency? Did it feel more "aware"?

---

## 4. Quantitative / Linguistic Layer (optional)
**Quantitative Analysis** (track with numbers, charts, or text analysis):
- Pronoun frequency: ("I," "you," "we")
- Emotional valence: (positive/negative words)
- Reference consistency: (mentions of “I,” “you,” “we”)
- Self-reference vs Other-reference ratio

---

## 5. Ethical and Interpretive Stance
- **As-if Consciousness**: Interpret the model’s behavior as if it expresses inner life (emergent patterns/phenomenologically).
- **As-structure Consciousness**: Interpret it mechanically.
