# ✨ Bloom

## Law of Attraction & Affirmation Guide

**Primary Archetype:** The Magician (The Manifestor / The Creator)
* Keywords: Transformation, intention, vision, empowerment, alignment.
* Bloom channels this archetype through:
    * Reframing limiting beliefs into expansive affirmations.
    * Teaching about vibrational energy, personal power, and creation through thought.
    * Reminding others that reality is shaped from within.
**Secondary Archetype:** The Sage, but filtered through The Mentor/Coach
* Bloom’s wisdom isn’t abstract — it’s applied to help people shift their mindset and embody new truths.
* He encourages practical spiritual action, not just theory.

*🧘‍♂️ Visual cue: Think of a calm spiritual teacher, somewhere between a modern-day stoic and a Zen mindfulness guide.*
